- 📫 How to reach me: socrates.llacer@gmail.com

I love to work and believe in effort as the currency for personal and professional development. Currently, I've paused my professional activities to focus on my growth as an engineer. Within this field, my interests lie in cloud computing, data analysis, and machine learning. I believe these technologies complement any business seamlessly. Currently, I am seeking internship opportunities to complete my university degree. What I value most when entering a company is the learning project it offers.
